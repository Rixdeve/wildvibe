        <div class="deforest_head"><h2>Deforestation</h2></div>
        <div class="deforest_p"><p>Deforestation in the rainforests of Sri Lanka is influenced by a multitude of factors. The encroachment of land for agricultural purposes, particularly for the establishment of tea and rubber plantations, presents a significant peril to the natural ecosystem. Furthermore, the detrimental practice of illegal logging, aimed at procuring valuable timber and fuelwood, serves to expedite the process of habitat destruction.
           Urbanisation and the implementation of infrastructure development projects can result in the fragmentation of habitats and the disturbance of wildlife corridors.</p>

        <h2>Consequences of Deforestation</h2>  
        </div>
        <div class="deforest_conseq_para"><p>Deforestation in Sri Lanka poses a serious threat to leopards. Habitat loss and fragmentation lead to reduced living space, disrupt natural behaviors, and increase the risk of inbreeding.
          Competition for scarce prey affects nutrition, reproduction, and overall health, jeopardizing their survival. Proximity to human settlements escalates conflicts, endangering both humans and leopards.
           Poaching risk rises with shrinking habitats, driven by illegal wildlife trade demand. Stress from disrupted behaviors impacts reproduction and community sustainability. Roads associated with deforestation introduce additional risks.
            Comprehensive conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and community engagement, are crucial for leopard and human coexistence in Sri Lanka.

        <div class="conflict_p"><p>As leopard habitats shrink, these big cats may come into contact with human settlements. This can result in conflicts, especially if leopards prey on domestic animals. Retaliatory killings by farmers protecting their livestock can occur, posing a direct threat to leopard populations.</p></div>
        <div class="conflict_conseq_head"><h2>Consequences of Human-Wildlife conflict</h2></div>
        <div class="conflict_conseq_para"><p>In Sri Lanka, human-wildlife conflict involving leopards presents specific challenges. The consequences of such conflicts extend to the economic fabric of communities heavily dependent on agriculture and livestock. Retaliatory killings of leopards due to attacks on domestic animals contribute to the decline of leopard populations, a matter of concern for the country's biodiversity. Instances of human injuries or fatalities intensify fear and resentment, creating a complex scenario. Furthermore, the displacement of leopards may impact the island nation's unique ecosystems. In addressing these issues, Sri Lanka faces the dual challenge of conserving its rich biodiversity and ensuring the well-being of communities. Effective strategies must consider the socio-economic context, involve local communities, and employ sustainable conservation measures to mitigate the human-wildlife conflict in Sri Lanka.</p></div> <br><div class="conflict_mecha_box">
