Situated 314 kilometers from Colombo in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, Maduru Oya National Park, established on 9th November 1983, spans an expansive 58,849 hectares and serves not only as a wildlife sanctuary but also as a catchment area for the Maduru Oya Reservoir under the Mahaweli development project.<br>

            Wildlife enthusiasts are in for a treat as Maduru Oya is renowned for its diverse fauna. While the park is famous for its elephant habitat, it is also home to elusive leopards, sloth bears, sambhur, spotted and barking deer, wild boar, and wild buffalo. The park is a sanctuary for various primates, including the Toque Macaque, Purple-faced Langur, and the nocturnal Slender Loris. Additionally, porcupines, black-naped hare, Indian pangolin, and a variety of squirrels inhabit the park, creating a thriving ecosystem.

            Birdwatchers can indulge in their passion with over 100 bird species, including the impressive Lesser Adjutant, Woolly-necked Stork, Openbill, Painted Stork, Racket-tailed Drongo, Yellow-fronted Barbet, and the iconic Sri Lanka jungle fowl. The diverse avian population adds a symphony of calls and colors to the park's vibrant landscape.
            <br>
            Maduru Oya is not only a haven for wildlife but also a cultural treasure trove. Within its boundaries reside the Veddas, the indigenous people of Sri Lanka, adding a unique dimension to the park. Immerse yourself in their rich traditions, learn about their ancient way of life, and witness a harmonious coexistence between these indigenous communities and the natural world.
            <br>
            The Maduru Oya Reservoir, a significant feature of the landscape, not only enhances the scenic beauty of the park but also provides opportunities for water-based activities. Visitors can engage in boat rides, fishing, or simply relax along the reservoir's shores, enjoying the tranquility that complements the park's adventurous side.
